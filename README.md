# Application Outline

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Main Purpose

This application acts as an online platform for a bakery shop located in Macquarie to sell their products to a wider range of customers through partnerships with delivery services.

## Target User Group

People who have a basic understanding on how the Internet works should be able to navigate through the application easily. It is expected that users of the application will possess a PayPal account, credit or debit card that can be utilized in their payment process. Targeted users share an interest in bakery goods and enjoy using food delivery services. 

## Data Sources

The logo of the application is designed by the team, hence no permission is required.

# Minimum Viable Product Outline

## Pages

The application contains 8 pages in total:
- Home
- Menu
- Single product view
- My order
- Cart
- Checkout
- About
- FAQ

## Features

A log in function is implemented to the web application, where customers can provide reviews and ratings on items purchased previously. Feedback can be provided through navigating to the "My Orders" page, which will appear after users log in to their account. 

### Home

Home page acts as a basic introduction page for the application. The page includes some images and a special review provided by famous food critics. A trending products display is added to the bottom section of the page, where a button is implemented along to bring users directly to the menu page.

### Menu

The menu page features all the products that the bakery shop sells. A search bar is attached to the top of the page, which should allow customers to easily find their targeted items. When users click on an item on the list, they will be redirected to the single product view page.

### Single Product View

A single product view page contains a basic description of the item selected. Customers who are interested in the product are permitted to choose their desired quantity and add the item into their cart. Some ratings and reviews provided by previous customers are also viewable by customers on the page. 

### Cart

Cart page allows customers to checkout the items that they have added or edit the quantity as desired. A delete option is available for customers who no longer show interest in a product added into cart.

### Cart

Upon confirmation, customers will be redirected to the checkout page, where they are permitted to select their preferred delivery partners and payment methods. The screen also displays a random number next to delivery fee estimation to make the page look more realistic.

### Contact

The page includes a simple description of the business with a google map stating the location of the physical store. Users can also find the social media accounts connected to the business on the bottom section of the page. The icons will link users to the main page of the social media stated but no actual account will appear. 

### FAQ

Accordion component is implemented under the page to build vertically collapsing boxes that display some usual questions that users will encounter when using a web application of such. A contact form is attached below the accordion, allowing users to send emails to the business for further enquiries.

# Available Scripts

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
